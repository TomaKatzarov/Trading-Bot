# RL Training Artifacts

This directory stores all reinforcement learning training artifacts, including configuration files, checkpoints, logs, and evaluation results. The subdirectories are structured to keep experiment assets organized and reproducible.

- `configs/`: Hyperparameter and environment configuration YAML files used to launch experiments.
- `checkpoints/`: Saved policy weights and optimizer states for trained agents.
- `logs/`: Console logs, TensorBoard summaries, and other run-time diagnostics.
- `results/`: Aggregated evaluation outputs such as metrics, plots, and reports.
