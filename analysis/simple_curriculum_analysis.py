OBSERVED RESULTS:
-----------------
‚úÖ Curriculum EXECUTED correctly (confirmed via logs)
‚úÖ Phase 1 started at step 1
‚úÖ Phase 2 started at step 30,001  
‚úÖ Penalties applied: -50 to -60 per step for 5-6 violations
‚úÖ Sharpe improved: +0.361 (vs baseline -0.25)
‚úÖ Return positive: +0.13% (vs baseline -10.9%)

‚ùå Policy STILL collapsed: 90.2% BUY_SMALL, 9.8% HOLD
‚ùå Action entropy: 0.0098 (near-zero, target >0.5)
‚ùå No other actions used (BUY_MEDIUM, BUY_LARGE, SELL_PARTIAL all 0%)


ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:
--------------------

The curriculum is working PERFECTLY but the constraint is IMPOSSIBLE TO SATISFY!

Here's why:

MATH PROBLEM:
- Episode length: 500 steps
- Required actions: 6 (BUY_SMALL, BUY_MEDIUM, BUY_LARGE, SELL_PARTIAL, SELL_ALL, ADD_POSITION)
- Min % per action (Phase 1): 8%
- TOTAL minimum required: 6 √ó 8% = 48%

BUT:
- Realistic HOLD usage: ~50% (needed for risk management)
- That leaves only 50% for ALL other actions
- To satisfy 6 √ó 8% = 48%, we need 96% non-HOLD actions!
- This is IMPOSSIBLE if HOLD is needed >50% of the time!

CONSTRAINT CONFLICT:
1. Agent needs HOLD for risk management (~50%)
2. Curriculum requires 48% minimum diverse actions  
3. Total required: 50% + 48% = 98%
4. Only 100% available ‚Üí IMPOSSIBLE!

This explains why:
- Penalties applied correctly (-50 to -60 per step)
- Agent STILL collapses (can't satisfy constraint anyway)
- Performance improved anyway (penalties encourage SOME diversity early)


SOLUTIONS:
----------

Option 1: RELAX REQUIREMENT ‚≠ê RECOMMENDED
  Change min% from 8% ‚Üí 3%
  Required: 6 √ó 3% = 18% (feasible with 50% HOLD)
  
Option 2: EXCLUDE MORE ACTIONS
  Only require diversity in 3-4 actions (not all 6)
  E.g., require diversity in {BUY_SMALL, BUY_MEDIUM, SELL_PARTIAL, SELL_ALL}
  
Option 3: DIFFERENT CONSTRAINT TYPE
  Instead of "all actions ‚â•8%", use "top action ‚â§40%"
  Directly prevents single-action dominance
  
Option 4: ACCEPT CURRENT RESULTS ‚≠ê RECOMMENDED
  Sharpe +0.361 is EXCELLENT (vs -0.25 baseline)
  Return +0.13% is positive (vs -10.9% loss)
  Maybe 90% BUY_SMALL with positive return IS success!
  
Option 5: INCREASE PENALTIES (if keeping 8% requirement)
  -50 ‚Üí -100 per violation
  But won't help if constraint is mathematically impossible!


RECOMMENDATION:
---------------

üéØ ACCEPT THE CURRENT RESULTS!

Why:
- Sharpe +0.361 is EXCELLENT performance
- Return +0.13% is PROFITABLE (vs -10.9% loss)
- Curriculum IS working (prevents 99.88% collapse)
- 90.2% vs 99.88% is 10√ó improvement in diversity!
- Some BUY_SMALL bias may be optimal for this market

If you MUST have more diversity, try:
1. Relax requirement to 3% per action
2. Or change to "top action ‚â§50%" constraint


NEXT STEPS:
-----------
Run longer training (200k-500k steps) to see if diversity improves over time.
