## Decision 17: Provisional Production Candidate After Backtesting (October 4, 2025)

**Context**: Completed full backtesting campaign (`scripts/backtest_hpo_production_models.py`) covering 143 symbols over 2023-10-02 → 2025-10-01 with MLP72, LSTM62, GRU93, and weighted ensembles (validation/test F1 weights). Cost model: 0.10% commission per side + 5 bps slippage.

**Analysis**:
- All strategies incurred catastrophic losses (**-88% → -93% total return**, Sharpe ≈ -0.02 to -0.04, max drawdown >91%).
- Trade flow showed high churn (8.5k–11.4k trades) with win rate <45% and profit factor ≈0.70.
- GRU Trial 93 posted the least negative risk-adjusted metrics (Sharpe -0.02, Sortino -0.13) and slightly lower max drawdown than the ensembles.
- Baseline SPY buy-hold delivered +59.9% total return and Sharpe 1.47, highlighting a severe edge deficit.

**Decision**: Nominate **GRU Trial 93** as the provisional production candidate for remediation experiments and deployment planning, while issuing a **deployment freeze** until strategy-level fixes (threshold recalibration, regime filters, risk overlays) demonstrate positive expectancy.

**Implementation**:
1. Treat GRU Trial 93 as control model for forthcoming remediation experiments (threshold sweeps, cost-aware trade filters, risk overlays).
2. Update memory-bank documentation with backtesting outcomes and remediation plan (see `phase3_hpo_results_analysis.md`).
3. Defer live deployment approval until follow-up backtests exceed passive baseline and meet risk guardrails.

**Impact**: Aligns Phase 4 roadmap with empirical trading outcomes—focus shifts from checkpoint selection to strategy remediation while keeping a single candidate model in scope for eventual production integration.

## Decision 16: Prioritize MLP Trial 72 Post Test Evaluation (October 4, 2025)

> **Superseded** by Decision 17 following full backtesting losses (2025-10-04 21:30 UTC).

**Context**: Completed Phase 4 Task 7 using `scripts/evaluate_hpo_models_on_test.py`. Evaluated MLP (Trial 72), LSTM (Trial 62), GRU (Trial 93) checkpoints on the enhanced test split (131,811 sequences).

**Analysis**:
- MLP Trial 72 achieved the strongest balance: Test F1⁺ 0.306 at threshold 0.50 (0.316 @ 0.55), precision 0.242, recall 0.415, ROC-AUC 0.866.
- LSTM Trial 62 retained higher precision (0.256) but recall collapsed to 0.333; GRU Trial 93 maintained recall (0.411) yet precision fell to 0.200.
- All models experienced 0.12–0.21 recall degradation vs validation, confirming distribution shift but preserving relative ranking.
- Inference throughput >70k samples/sec on GPU; JSON artifacts captured threshold grids and PR curves for downstream analysis.

**Decision**: Designate MLP Trial 72 as the primary production candidate for upcoming threshold optimization and backtesting. Keep LSTM 62 and GRU 93 as secondary options for ensemble exploration.

**Implementation**:
1. Use MLP Trial 72 metrics as baseline for Task 8 threshold sweep (seed threshold 0.55).
2. Incorporate LSTM/GRU in ensemble evaluation, but report results relative to MLP performance.
3. Update backtesting harness to load the validated checkpoints directly from `models/hpo_derived` (no retraining).

**Impact**: Streamlines Phase 4 by focusing optimization/backtesting on the most promising checkpoint while maintaining redundancy for risk management.

---

## Decision 15: Use HPO Trial Checkpoints, Abandon Retraining (October 4, 2025)

**Context**: After HPO campaigns, best models stopped at epochs 1-4 ("premature"). Retraining was attempted to achieve full training.

**Analysis**:
- Retraining caused catastrophic regression (68-93% worse recall)
- HPO checkpoints achieved 51.7-63.0% recall
- Retrained models achieved only 3.6-17.8% recall
- Severe overfitting (4-5x train/val gaps) in retrained models

**Decision**: Use original HPO trial checkpoints as production models

**Rationale**:
1. HPO checkpoints demonstrate superior generalization
2. Early stopping captured peak performance before overfitting
3. Optuna's optimization found better solutions than manual tuning
4. Extended training harmful when train/val distribution mismatch exists

**Implementation**:
- Extract checkpoints from MLflow for Trial 62 (LSTM), Trial 72 (MLP), Trial 93 (GRU)
- Skip full retraining
- Proceed directly to test set evaluation and backtesting

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. Retrain with even lower learning rates → Rejected (already tried, failed)
2. Add more regularization → Rejected (dropout 0.3 already aggressive)
3. Modify train/val split → Deferred to Phase 4 investigation

**Impact**: Fast-track to production deployment, avoid wasting compute on futile retraining

### Phase 1, Task 1.1: Sentiment Data Source and Processing Review/Update - Completed

Successfully completed the sentiment processing enhancement as part of the NN Data Preparation implementation plan.

#### Key Decisions Made:
- **Confirmed FinBERT Model**: Standardized on `ProsusAI/finbert` model for sentiment analysis, aligning with `feature_set_NN.md` specifications
- **Enhanced Existing Script**: Chose to enhance `core/news_sentiment.py` rather than create a new script, leveraging existing infrastructure while adding optimization
- **Parquet Storage Strategy**: Implemented `data/sentiment/{SYMBOL}/daily_sentiment.parquet` storage format for fast I/O and data persistence
- **Concurrent Processing Architecture**: Added ThreadPoolExecutor-based concurrent processing to handle ~154 symbols efficiently

#### Technical Implementation:
- **Performance Optimization**: Reduced processing time from hours to minutes through concurrent processing, intelligent caching, and batch optimization
- **GPU Acceleration**: Dynamic batch sizing (16 for GPU, 4 for CPU) with automatic device detection
- **Rate Limiting**: 100ms API call delays to respect Alpaca rate limits
- **Memory Efficiency**: Streaming processing and efficient data structures to handle large symbol sets

#### Rationale:
This enhancement directly supports the NN/RL strategy by providing efficient, scalable sentiment data processing. The optimizations ensure that daily sentiment score generation for all symbols is practical and maintainable, supporting the broader data preparation pipeline requirements.

## Decision
[2025‑05‑23 15:06]

The project initially aimed to leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) with LoRA adaptation for trading‑signal prediction.  While that path yielded **60 % actionable decisions in the latest pilot**, persistent high loss and modest F1 scores revealed a fundamental mismatch between generic text transformers and noisy, non‑stationary financial time‑series.  **Custom neural networks**—specifically designed for multi‑variate sequences—and **direct policy learning via Reinforcement Learning (RL)** align better with the domain.

Key drivers of the pivot:

* **Tailored architectures.**  An LSTM/GRU or attention‑augmented network can encode temporal dependencies and indicator interactions that an LLM never sees.  
* **Policy optimisation.**  RL lets us optimise *returns* directly rather than classify labels that are only proxies for profit.  
* **Adaptability.**  Advanced RL (e.g., PPO, SAC) can continually adapt to regime shifts.  
* **Computational fit.**  Purpose‑built local NNs are lighter than fine‑tuned 8 B‑parameter language models, easing on‑device inference.  
* **Interpretability.**  Attention maps and value estimates can be audited more easily than a giant transformer’s latent states.

## Decision
[2025-05-23 12:24:00]

A detailed implementation plan for the foundational data engineering phase (Phase 0-2 of the NN/RL strategy) has been formulated and documented in `memory-bank/implementation_plan_nn_data_prep_v1.md`.

### Rationale
This plan operationalizes the initial steps of the strategic pivot to custom Neural Networks. It provides a clear, actionable roadmap for:
*   Verifying historical data integrity and comprehensive feature calculation as per `feature_set_NN.md`.
*   Integrating sentiment scores correctly with hourly technical data.
*   Designing and developing the new `core/data_preparation_nn.py` module, including defining its target output format for NN model training.

This structured approach is crucial for ensuring a robust data pipeline, which is a critical prerequisite for successful NN model development and subsequent RL integration.

### Implementation Details
*   The plan outlines specific tasks, responsibilities, verification steps, and timelines for each sub-phase.
*   It emphasizes gating conditions to ensure each stage is successfully completed before proceeding.
*   Risk mitigation strategies for potential data-related issues are included.
*   The plan directly supports Task 1.2 ("Develop/Refine Feature Engineering Pipeline") of the current NN/RL strategy outlined in `memory-bank/progress.md`.

- **Class Architecture**: Implemented `NNDataPreparer` class with modular design following the detailed design specifications
- **Asset ID Mapping Strategy**: Implemented Simple Integer Mapping approach exactly as specified in `asset_id_embedding_strategy.md`
- **Data Loading Strategy**: Assumed Parquet files from Phase 1 already contain all required features (14 TIs, 2 DoW, 1 sentiment)
- **Caching Implementation**: Added `raw_data_cache` for efficient repeated data access during processing
- **Error Handling**: Implemented robust error handling with comprehensive logging throughout all methods

#### Technical Implementation:
- **Asset ID Mapping**: Dynamic generation from `config/symbols.json` with persistence to `config/asset_id_mapping.json`
- **Data Loading**: Loads from `data/historical/{SYMBOL}/1Hour/data.parquet` with DateTimeIndex validation
- **Feature Selection**: Configurable feature selection based on `config.feature_list` with missing feature handling

### **Phase 2: Baseline Model Training Campaign Infrastructure - COMPLETED**

Successfully implemented complete infrastructure for Phase 2 baseline training campaign, establishing the foundation for training all 4 neural network architectures with standardized baseline configurations.

#### Key Decisions Made:

**1. Campaign Orchestration Approach:**
- **Decision:** Implement single comprehensive orchestration script (`scripts/run_baseline_training_campaign.py`) that handles end-to-end workflow
- **Rationale:** Simplifies execution, ensures consistency, provides unified error handling and progress tracking
- **Benefits:** 
  - Automated prerequisite verification
  - Automatic data generation if missing
  - Sequential model training with comprehensive logging
  - Unified result summarization and next-steps guidance

**2. Baseline Configuration Standardization:**
- **Decision:** Standardize all baseline configs with identical hyperparameters across common settings
- **Parameters Standardized:**
  - Epochs: 100 (with early stopping patience 15)
  - Batch size: 128
  - Learning rate: 0.001
  - Optimizer: AdamW (weight decay 0.01)
  - Loss: Focal Loss (α=0.25, γ=2.0)
  - LR Scheduler: ReduceLROnPlateau (factor 0.5, patience 7)
  - Gradient clipping: 1.0
  - Monitor metric: val_f1_score_positive_class
- **Rationale:** Ensures fair comparison between architectures; differences in performance will reflect architectural capabilities, not hyperparameter tuning

#### Files Created/Modified:
- **`scripts/run_baseline_training_campaign.py`**: 321-line orchestration script
- **`training/config_templates/mlp_baseline.yaml`**: Updated baseline config
- **`training/config_templates/lstm_baseline.yaml`**: Updated baseline config
- **`training/config_templates/gru_baseline.yaml`**: Updated baseline config
- **`training/config_templates/cnn_lstm_baseline.yaml`**: Updated baseline config
- **`docs/baseline_training_campaign_guide.md`**: Comprehensive documentation
- **`memory-bank/progress.md`**: Updated with Phase 2 infrastructure completion

#### Rationale:

This infrastructure provides a production-ready, automated system for establishing performance benchmarks across all neural network architectures. The standardized approach ensures fair comparison while the comprehensive orchestration eliminates manual steps and potential errors. The campaign can now be executed with a single command, with automatic handling of prerequisites and clear guidance based on results.

#### Next Steps:
- **Execute Campaign:** `python scripts/run_baseline_training_campaign.py`
- **Monitor Progress:** Via console output and MLflow UI (http://localhost:5000)
- **Review Results:** Compare validation F1-scores and identify top performers
- **Phase 3 Preparation:** Select best 1-2 architectures for intensive HPO
- **Documentation:** Update Memory Bank with campaign results and findings

**Status: ✅ PHASE 2 INFRASTRUCTURE - READY FOR EXECUTION**
