## � BACKTESTING CAMPAIGN FAILURE - October 4, 2025 (Night)

**Phase 4 Status**: Full-universe backtesting (2023-10-02 → 2025-10-01) completed for MLP72, LSTM62, GRU93, and weighted ensembles.

**Headline Metrics**:
- Total return range: **-88% → -93%** across all model strategies (after 0.10% commission + 5bps slippage).
- Risk-adjusted profile: Sharpe ≈ **-0.02 to -0.04**, Sortino ≈ -0.13 to -0.15, max drawdown > **91%** for every model.
- Trade activity: **8.5k–11.4k** trades per model with win rate <45% and profit factor ≈0.70.
- Baseline comparison: SPY buy-hold delivered +59.9% total return, Sharpe 1.47 over the same window.

**Key Takeaways**:
- Signal quality does not translate into profitable trades under realistic cost structure—models systematically lose money.
- Ensembles do not mitigate risk; they inherit (and slightly worsen) drawdown and Sharpe metrics.
- GRU Trial 93 ranks “least negative” (Sharpe -0.02) and is earmarked for remediation experiments, **not** immediate deployment.

**Immediate Focus**: Launch structured post-mortem—distribution shift analysis, threshold/position-sizing recalibration, and regime-aware risk overlays before any production consideration.

**Artifacts**: `backtesting/results/full_campaign/` (metrics JSON, trade logs, plots) and updated narrative in `memory-bank/phase3_hpo_results_analysis.md`.

## �🔥 CRITICAL UPDATE - October 4, 2025 (Evening)

**Phase 3 Status**: HPO checkpoints validated on the held-out test set. MLP Trial 72 remains the leading production candidate; LSTM/GRU show consistent but lower recall.

**Key Findings**:
- Test set evaluation complete (`scripts/evaluate_hpo_models_on_test.py`)
- Test metrics (F1⁺ @0.50 / Recall⁺ / Precision⁺):
    - **MLP Trial 72**: 0.306 / 0.415 / 0.242 → Optimal threshold 0.55 improves F1⁺ to 0.316
    - **LSTM Trial 62**: 0.289 / 0.333 / 0.256
    - **GRU Trial 93**: 0.269 / 0.411 / 0.200
- ROC-AUC range: 0.83–0.87; PR-AUC range: 0.20–0.24; log-loss 0.29–0.48
- Validation vs Test comparison shows ~10–20% recall drop, but ordering of models unchanged
- Full backtest (2023-10-02 → 2025-10-01) returns **-88% to -93%** across all checkpoints and ensembles; classification gains did not translate into profitable trading.

**Immediate Next Steps**: Backtest post-mortem (distribution shift, cost sensitivity), threshold/position-sizing remediation experiments, and deployment decision checkpoint (Phase 4 Tasks 8–10 re-scoped).

# Project Progress: Custom Neural Network & Reinforcement Learning Strategy (Effective 2025-05-11)

This document outlines the progress for the new strategic direction focusing on a custom Neural Network (NN) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach for autonomous trading.

## Archived: Previous LoRA-Based Strategy Progress

*   **Phase 1: PnL-Based LoRA Retraining (Data Focus)** – *Concluded & Superseded by NN/RL Strategy (2025-05-11)*
    *   All steps related to PnL target logic, data preparation for LoRA, risk management for LoRA, quantitative evaluation for LoRA, and wrapper script updates are considered complete within the context of the previous strategy.
    *   The final LoRA retraining effort (Step 7) is now archived as the strategy has pivoted.
    *   **Note on Pivot:** The LLM/LoRA approach, despite some positive signals, did not achieve satisfactory overall performance (e.g., high training loss, modest F1 scores for actionable classes, low overall accuracy). This led to a strategic pivot towards a custom Neural Network and Reinforcement Learning approach.
    *   **Final LLM/LoRA Outcome Summary:** Final LLM/LoRA pilot (Qwen3-8B, 3-class) showed modest F1 for actionable classes but low overall accuracy and high training loss, prompting a strategic review and pivot.

*   **Phase 2: LoRA Integration and Evaluation** – *Partially Completed & Superseded by NN/RL Strategy (2025-05-11)*
    *   Steps related to LoRA adapter integration, qualitative evaluation, and comparative LoRA reporting are complete.
    *   Further quantitative backtesting and baseline comparison for LoRA models are superseded by the new NN/RL strategy.

*   **Phase 3: LoRA Iteration and Refinement** – *Superseded by NN/RL Strategy (2025-05-11)*

This report will serve as a reference as we move to RL.
    *   [ ] **1.4.6 Final Documentation & Memory Bank Update:** Status: **Pending.**  
            – After completing the above, update all memory-bank documents (design docs, strategic plan) with the final decisions and outcomes of Phase 1.  
            – Summarize baseline model specs and performance for reference in Phase 2.
*   **Deliverables (Target):**

    *   Robust backtesting engine. **COMPLETED (2025-05-28 00:34:00)** - All advanced validation techniques and threshold optimization integrated.
    *   Trained supervised NN model(s) with documented baseline performance. *Pending*
    *   Report on NN architecture selection, feature importance, and baseline metrics. *(Pending completion of Phase 1.4.5)*

### Phase 2 (New Strategy): RL Environment & Agent Integration
*   **Timeline Estimate:** ~4–6 Months (Following Phase 1 – **adjusted start due to Phase 1 extension**)
*   **Overall Status:** [Not Started] (Pending satisfactory completion of Phase 1)
*   **Key Activities & Status:**
    *   [ ] **2.1 Develop High-Fidelity Market Simulation Environment for RL:**
        *   Status: Pending. (To commence once baseline model is ready; some preliminary design may occur in parallel.) 
        *   *Notes:* This involves creating a realistic trading environment (possibly leveraging the backtester) where an RL agent can interact (observe state, take buy/hold/sell actions, receive rewards). Will incorporate transaction costs, slippage, etc., for realism.
    *   [ ] **2.2 Integrate Pre-trained Custom NN into RL Agent:**
        *   Status: Pending.
        *   *Notes:* Use the trained supervised model (from Phase 1) as the starting point (policy network) for the RL agent. The NN may act as the policy network (mapping state to action probabilities) or as part of the value network in an Actor-Critic setup. Ensure the integration allows the agent to either fine-tune the network weights or use its outputs as features.
    *   [ ] **2.3 Define Initial State Representation, Action Space, and Reward Function:**
        *   Status: Pending.
        *   *Notes:* Decide how the environment state is represented for the RL agent (likely the same 10 features + maybe position status). Define the action space (e.g., discrete: Buy, Sell, Hold, or continuous position sizing). Define reward function aligned with trading objectives (e.g., profit and risk-adjusted returns). This step is critical for guiding the RL agent’s learning.
    *   [ ] **2.4 Implement and Train Initial RL Agent:**
        *   Status: Pending.
        *   *Notes:* Select an RL algorithm (e.g., DDPG, PPO, or DQN for discrete actions). Implement the training loop where the agent interacts with the simulation environment. Use the policy initialized from 2.2. Train over multiple episodes/epochs, tuning hyperparameters (exploration rate, etc.). Monitor performance improvements against the baseline strategy. 
        *   This will likely be iterative: we may adjust reward or model architecture if the agent struggles. Aim to have an agent that at least matches the baseline model’s performance and ideally exceeds it by optimizing decisions (e.g., learning when not to trade).
*   **Deliverables (Target):**
    *   High-fidelity RL simulation environment. *(To be delivered mid-Phase 2)*
    *   Integrated RL agent using the custom NN. *(To be delivered mid-Phase 2)* 
    *   Initial trained RL agent with documented performance in simulation. *(End of Phase 2 deliverable)*
    *   Report on RL algorithm selection, state/action/reward design choices, and training results.

### Phase 3 (New Strategy): Advanced RL & Iteration
*   **Timeline Estimate:** Ongoing (6+ Months, Following Phase 2)
*   **Overall Status:** [Not Started]
*   **Key Activities & Status:**
    *   [ ] **3.1 Explore Advanced RL Techniques (Unsupervised/Self-Supervised, Auxiliary Models):**
        *   Status: Pending.
        *   *Notes:* Experiment with techniques like reward shaping, curiosity-driven learning, or unsupervised pre-training for the RL agent to improve its robustness. Possibly explore model-based RL or meta-learning if needed.
    *   [ ] **3.2 Iterate on NN Architecture:**
        *   Status: Pending.
        *   *Notes:* Re-evaluate the neural network architecture in the context of RL. Perhaps introduce memory (LSTM) into the policy if not already, or try a transformer if sequence length grows. Optimize the network for faster inference (important for live trading).
    *   [ ] **3.3 Iterate on Features:**
        *   Status: Pending.
        *   *Notes:* Based on performance analysis, add or modify input features. E.g., introduce new technical indicators, alternative sentiment measures, or macro features. If the agent shows weakness in certain scenarios, include regime indicators or other context features.
    *   [ ] **3.4 Iterate on RL Agent (Algorithms, Hyperparameters, Reward):**
        *   Status: Pending.
        *   *Notes:* Try different RL algorithms or fine-tune hyperparameters. Possibly move from a simple algorithm to a more advanced one (e.g., from DQN to an Actor-Critic method) if needed. Adjust reward function if the current one doesn’t capture long-term goals (e.g., incorporate risk-adjusted metrics into reward).
    *   [ ] **3.5 Rigorous Testing & Validation (Walk-Forward, Regime Sensitivity):**
        *   Status: Pending.
        *   *Notes:* Perform extensive out-of-sample testing of the RL agent. Use walk-forward validation on multiple time periods (e.g., simulate trading from 2018-2023, sequentially). Test the agent’s performance in various market conditions (trending vs volatile vs crash scenarios) to evaluate its robustness. Identify any failure modes.
*   **Deliverables (Target):**
    *   Improved RL agents with enhanced adaptability and robustness.
    *   Documentation of experiments (which techniques/changes were tried and results).
    *   Regular performance reports (e.g., monthly evaluation of the agent on recent data during paper trading).

### Phase 4 (New Strategy): Deployment & Monitoring (Paper Trading)
*   **Timeline Estimate:** Ongoing (Concurrent with late Phase 3)
*   **Overall Status:** [Not Started]
*   **Key Activities & Status:**
    *   [ ] **4.1 Select Best Performing Agent for Paper Trading:**
        *   Status: Pending.
        *   *Notes:* Decide which model/agent configuration from Phase 3 will be deployed in a live paper trading environment. Criteria will include consistency, profitability, and stability. Potentially keep multiple agents in consideration (for ensemble or fallback).
    *   [ ] **4.2 Develop Deployment Infrastructure:**
        *   Status: Pending.
        *   *Notes:* Set up the infrastructure needed to run the trading agent in real-time using Alpaca’s paper trading API. This involves connecting the RL agent’s decisions to live data feeds, trade execution module, and ensuring all components (data preprocessing, model inference, decision logic) work in real-time constraints.
    *   [ ] **4.3 Implement Continuous Monitoring and Performance Tracking:**
        *   Status: Pending.
        *   *Notes:* Create a dashboard or logging system to monitor the paper trading performance of the agent. Track key metrics like daily P&L, win rate, drawdowns, as well as model inputs/outputs for troubleshooting. Set up alerts for anomalies (e.g., if the agent starts taking too many trades or incurring losses beyond a threshold).
    *   [ ] **4.4 Define Regular Model Review and Retraining Strategy:**
        *   Status: Pending.
        *   *Notes:* Plan how we will periodically update the model/agent. This could include schedules for retraining the supervised model on new data, fine-tuning or re-training the RL agent as more data (or new market regime) becomes available, and criteria for when a model upgrade is needed. Establish a process for human oversight to review model decisions periodically.
*   **Deliverables (Target):**
    *   Deployed RL trading agent in a paper trading environment (running on live market data in simulation mode).
    *   Live monitoring dashboard and alerting system for the trading agent’s performance and behavior.
    *   Defined process for ongoing maintenance and model updates (to ensure the agent remains adaptive to market changes and any degradation in performance is addressed).
