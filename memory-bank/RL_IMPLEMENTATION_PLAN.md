# Multi-Agent RL Trading System Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary
The Trading Bot program will evolve into a production-ready multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) trading platform over an 18-week horizon (≈4.5 months). The roadmap is segmented into eight progressive phases—from foundational setup through production readiness—each with explicit deliverables, success criteria, quality gates, and rollback strategies. By Week 18 the team targets a validated, risk-managed portfolio orchestrated by 143 symbol agents and a master agent that collectively outperform existing supervised learning (SL) baselines and the SPY benchmark.

**Core goals for this initiative**
- Replace the current single-model SL pipeline with a scalable multi-agent RL architecture.
- Achieve portfolio-level Sharpe ratio > 1.0, max drawdown < 30%, and >5% annualized outperformance vs. SPY buy-and-hold.
- Deliver repeatable training, evaluation, and deployment workflows with full observability, risk controls, and documentation.

**High-level timeline**
- **Weeks 1-2:** Phase 0 — Foundational environment, data, checkpoints, baseline documentation.
- **Weeks 3-4:** Phase 1 — Trading environment creation, validation, and benchmarking.
- **Weeks 5-6:** Phase 2 — Agent architectures, shared encoders, policy modules.
- **Weeks 7-8:** Phase 3 — Prototype training on 10 symbols with analysis and tuning.
- **Weeks 9-12:** Phase 4 — Scale training to 143 agents with distributed infrastructure.
- **Weeks 13-14:** Phase 5 — Master agent development and (optional) joint fine-tuning.
- **Weeks 15-16:** Phase 6 — Comprehensive validation, stress, and sensitivity testing.
- **Weeks 17-18:** Phase 7 — Production hardening, monitoring, documentation, GO/NO-GO decision.

Progression between phases requires meeting well-defined success metrics, passing quality gates, and completing deliverables. Rollback plans ensure safe recovery from phase-level failures without jeopardizing the overall schedule.

#### Task 3.3: Baseline Training Run (2-3 days)

**Owner:** MLE
**Dependencies:** Task 3.2 complete

**3.3.1: Execute Initial Training**

```bash
# Activate RL environment
source trading_rl_env/Scripts/activate

# Start MLflow server (separate terminal)
mlflow server --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8080

# Start TensorBoard (separate terminal)
tensorboard --logdir logs/phase3_training

# Train all 10 agents
python training/train_phase3_agents.py \
  --config training/config_templates/phase3_ppo_baseline.yaml
  --output-dir training/rl/phase3_output
```

**Training Schedule:**
- Sequential training: ~10 hours per agent (8 parallel envs × 100k steps)
- Total wall-clock: ~100-120 hours (4-5 days single GPU)
- **Optimization:** Run 2 symbols in parallel on separate GPU cores → 2-3 days

**3.3.2: Monitor Training Metrics**

Track in MLflow + TensorBoard:
- **Policy Metrics:** Loss, entropy, clip fraction, KL divergence
- **Value Function:** Value loss, explained variance
- **Environment:** Episode reward, episode length, success rate
- **Agent-Specific:** Per-agent Sharpe, drawdown, trade count

**Warning Signs:**
- ❌ NaN losses (gradient explosion) → reduce LR or increase grad clipping
- ❌ Entropy → 0 too fast (premature convergence) → increase ent_coef
- ❌ Explained variance < 0 (poor value estimates) → check reward scaling
- ❌ All actions = HOLD (degenerate policy) → check reward weights

**3.3.3: Validation Evaluation**

Every 5k steps, evaluate on validation set:
- Run 10 episodes per agent on val split (2025 Q1-Q2)
- Compute:
  - Mean episode reward
  - Sharpe ratio
  - Max drawdown
  - Win rate
  - Total trades
- Save best checkpoint based on Sharpe ratio

**3.3.4: SL Baseline Comparison**

After training complete:
- Run validation backtest with SL checkpoints (threshold 0.80)
- Compare RL vs SL on same val period:
  - Sharpe: RL target ≥0.50 vs SL -0.05
  - Return: RL target ≥+12% vs SL -10.9%
  - Drawdown: RL target ≤25% vs SL 12.4%

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ ≥5/10 agents complete 100k steps without crashes
- ✅ ≥3/10 agents achieve validation Sharpe >0.3
- ✅ No agent shows degenerate behavior (all HOLD)
- ✅ At least 1 agent beats SL baseline on Sharpe

---

#### Task 3.4: Hyperparameter Tuning (2-3 days)

**Owner:** MLE
**Dependencies:** Task 3.3 baseline results

**3.4.1: Identify Tuning Priorities**

Based on baseline results, prioritize:

**High Priority (tune first):**
1. **Learning Rate:** Impacts convergence speed and stability
2. **Entropy Coefficient:** Controls exploration vs exploitation
3. **Reward Scaling:** Affects value function learning

**Medium Priority:**
4. **GAE Lambda:** Bias-variance tradeoff
5. **Clip Range:** Policy update magnitude
6. **Batch Size:** Sample efficiency

**Low Priority (use defaults):**
7. **N Epochs:** Usually 10 is fine
8. **Hidden Dim:** Architecture already validated

**3.4.2: Grid Search Strategy**

Create `training/rl/configs/phase3_tuning_grid.yaml`:

```yaml
hyperparameters:
  learning_rate: [1e-4, 3e-4, 1e-3]
  ent_coef: [0.001, 0.01, 0.05]
  gae_lambda: [0.90, 0.95, 0.98]
  clip_range: [0.1, 0.2, 0.3]

# 3×3×3×3 = 81 combinations → too many
# Use random search: 20-30 trials
strategy: random
num_trials: 25
eval_metric: validation_sharpe
```

**3.4.3: Optuna Integration**

```python
import optuna

def objective(trial):
    lr = trial.suggest_float("lr", 1e-4, 1e-3, log=True)
    ent_coef = trial.suggest_float("ent_coef", 1e-3, 5e-2, log=True)
    gae_lambda = trial.suggest_float("gae_lambda", 0.9, 0.98)
    
    # Train subset (e.g., SPY only for speed)
    val_sharpe = train_and_eval(
        symbol="SPY",
        lr=lr,
        ent_coef=ent_coef,
        gae_lambda=gae_lambda,
        total_timesteps=50000,  # Half of baseline
    )
    
    return val_sharpe

study = optuna.create_study(direction="maximize")
study.optimize(objective, n_trials=25)
```

**3.4.4: Best Config Selection**

After tuning:
- Select top 3 configs by validation Sharpe
- Retrain on all 10 symbols with each config
- Choose final config based on:
  - Avg Sharpe across 10 symbols
  - Stability (low Sharpe std across symbols)
  - Training stability (low crash rate)

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Tuning completes 20+ trials
- ✅ Best config improves ≥10% over baseline
- ✅ Final config exported to `phase3_best_config.yaml`

- **State-Action Heatmap:** Actions vs portfolio state
- **Attention Weights:** Encoder attention on technical features
- **Value Landscape:** Value estimates across states

**3.5.2: Reward Component Analysis**

Decompose reward into 7 components:
- Plot time-series of each component contribution
- Identify dominant components (should be balanced)
- Check for reward hacking (e.g., gaming time efficiency)

**3.5.3: Regime Robustness**

Test agents on different market regimes:
- **Bull Market:** 2024 Q1 (SPY +10%)
- **Bear Market:** 2024 Q3 (SPY -5%)
- **Sideways:** 2024 Q2 (SPY flat)

Verify performance doesn't collapse in any regime.

**3.5.4: Out-of-Sample Test**

Final validation on held-out test set (Aug-Oct 2025):
- Run 20 episodes per agent
- Compute final metrics
- Compare to validation metrics (should be similar)

**3.5.5: Phase 3 Completion Report**

---

#### Rollback Plan

**If agents fail to meet Sharpe targets:**
1. **Reward Rebalancing:** Adjust 7-component weights (Phase 1 task)
2. **Architecture Simplification:** Reduce transformer layers 4→2
3. **Extended Training:** Increase to 200k steps per agent
4. **Symbol Subset:** Focus on best 5 symbols, debug issues

**If training instabilities persist:**
1. **Gradient Analysis:** Check grad norms, add diagnostic logging
2. **Reward Clipping:** Add reward normalization or clipping
3. **Ablation Study:** Remove action masking, simplify to 3 actions
4. **Expert Consultation:** Engage RLS for reward hacking investigation

**If timeline exceeds 10 days:**
1. **Parallel Training:** Use 2 GPUs to run symbols in parallel
2. **Reduce Tuning:** Use baseline hyperparameters, skip Optuna
3. **Extend Phase:** Request 1-week extension with stakeholder approval

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Description | Mitigation | Owner | Detection Signals |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Training instability | High | High | PPO may diverge or collapse | Curriculum learning, reward shaping iterations, gradient clipping, early stopping | MLE + RLS | NaN losses, plateaued rewards |
| Underperforming agents | Medium | High | RL agents fail to beat SL baseline | Hyperparameter tuning, hybrid reward components, fallback to SL improvements | MLE + RM | Validation Sharpe below targets |
| Compute bottlenecks | Medium | High | 143 agents strain GPU/CPU resources | Ray autoscaling, cloud burst plan, staggered training windows | DevOps | Training queue delays |
| Data quality issues | Low | High | Missing features or sentiment data | Phase 0 validation, automated data checks before training | MLE | Data validation alerts |
| Reward hacking | Medium | Medium | Agents exploit loopholes (e.g., minimal trading) | Reward auditing, policy visualization, degenerate behavior tests | MLE + RLS | Degenerate action distributions |
| Overfitting | Medium | Medium | Good in-sample but poor out-of-sample | Walk-forward validation, regularization, dropout, randomization | MLE + RM | OOS performance drop |
| Monitoring gaps | Low | High | Production incidents unnoticed | Implement comprehensive logging, alerts, rehearsed drills | DevOps + RM | Missing alert coverage |

## Success Criteria

### Phase-Level Success Gates
- **Phase 0:** Environment, data, SL baselines ready; scripts executed successfully.
- **Phase 1:** Environments validated with tests, performance, and compatibility benchmarks.
- **Phase 2:** Architectures implemented with forward-pass tests and documented budgets.
- **Phase 3:** ≥5/10 prototype agents exceed Sharpe thresholds and stability achieved.
- **Phase 4:** ≥90% of 143 agents meet validation Sharpe >0.2 with reliable infrastructure.
- **Phase 5:** Master agent lifts portfolio Sharpe >0.8 with drawdown <30%.
- **Phase 6:** System passes walk-forward, stress, comparison, sensitivity, and OOS tests.
- **Phase 7:** Serving, risk, monitoring, docs ready; GO/NO-GO decision made.

### Final Success Metrics (Week 18)
- Portfolio Sharpe > 1.0 (validation), max drawdown < 30%, win rate > 50%, profit factor > 1.3.
- Outperforms SPY by >5% annualized and best SL configuration.

- Portfolio Sharpe > 0.6 with positive returns and controlled risk.

## Quality Gates & Validation Checkpoints
- **Gate 0→1:** Environment/data scripts signed off; baseline report approved.
- **Gate 1→2:** Environment unit tests + benchmarks verified; architecture interfaces stable.
- **Gate 2→3:** Encoder/policy tests green; PPO training dry-run completed.
- **Gate 3→4:** Prototype analysis accepted; hyperparameters frozen.
- **Gate 4→5:** Validation dashboard shows ≥90% agents meeting criteria.
- **Gate 5→6:** Master agent backtest confirms Sharpe/drawdown targets.
- **Gate 6→7:** Validation dossier approved by RM and leadership.
- **Post Phase 7:** GO/NO-GO meeting documented.

## Rollback Strategies by Phase
- **Phase 0:** Revert to prior environment snapshots; prioritize fixing environment/data before progressing.
- **Phase 1:** Simplify observation space; rollback to minimal reward; postpone vectorization if necessary.
- **Phase 2:** Swap transformer encoder for simpler MLP/LSTM temporarily; maintain interface to avoid downstream breakage.
- **Phase 3:** Pause scaling, revisit hyperparameters, consider reward adjustments; extend timeline ≤1 week.
- **Phase 4:** Suspend failing agent groups, re-run with adjusted configs; use cloud burst to recover schedule.
- **Phase 5:** Roll back to frozen-symbol baseline; disable joint fine-tuning if destabilizing.
- **Phase 6:** Identify weak windows/regimes, retrain specific agents or re-weight portfolio; do not proceed to production until resolved.
- **Phase 7:** Delay deployment, iterate on latency or risk controls; preserve validated models until issues resolved.

## Monitoring, Reporting, and Communication Cadence
- **Weekly status reports:** Progress, blockers, metrics per phase, shared with stakeholders every Friday.
- **Phase transition reviews:** 1-hour meeting to review success criteria, quality gate artifacts, and approve progression.
- **Incident channel:** Dedicated Slack/Teams channel for training incidents, with documented escalation path.
- **Documentation updates:** Memory-bank docs refreshed at the end of each phase, ensuring knowledge continuity.

## Iteration & Adaptation Guidelines
- **Behind schedule:** Reduce agent scope (e.g., train top 50 symbols first), skip joint fine-tuning, or extend timeline with stakeholder approval while preserving quality gates.
- **Ahead of schedule:** Explore advanced architectures (GNNs), alternative RL algorithms (SAC, TD3), or accelerated paper trading entry.
- **If outcomes disappointing:** Reinvest in SL enhancements (threshold tuning, regime filters), adopt hybrid strategies (RL timing + SL selection), or engage external RL expertise.
