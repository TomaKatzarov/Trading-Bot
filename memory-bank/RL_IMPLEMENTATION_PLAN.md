# Multi-Agent RL Trading System Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary
The Trading Bot program will evolve into a production-ready multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) trading platform over an 18-week horizon (≈4.5 months). The roadmap is segmented into eight progressive phases—from foundational setup through production readiness—each with explicit deliverables, success criteria, quality gates, and rollback strategies. By Week 18 the team targets a validated, risk-managed portfolio orchestrated by 143 symbol agents and a master agent that collectively outperform existing supervised learning (SL) baselines and the SPY benchmark.

**Core goals for this initiative**
- Replace the current single-model SL pipeline with a scalable multi-agent RL architecture.
- Achieve portfolio-level Sharpe ratio > 1.0, max drawdown < 30%, and >5% annualized outperformance vs. SPY buy-and-hold.
- Deliver repeatable training, evaluation, and deployment workflows with full observability, risk controls, and documentation.

**High-level timeline**
- **Weeks 1-2:** Phase 0 — Foundational environment, data, checkpoints, baseline documentation.
- **Weeks 3-4:** Phase 1 — Trading environment creation, validation, and benchmarking.
- **Weeks 5-6:** Phase 2 — Agent architectures, shared encoders, policy modules.
- **Weeks 7-8:** Phase 3 — Prototype training on 10 symbols with analysis and tuning.
- **Weeks 9-12:** Phase 4 — Scale training to 143 agents with distributed infrastructure.
- **Weeks 13-14:** Phase 5 — Master agent development and (optional) joint fine-tuning.
- **Weeks 15-16:** Phase 6 — Comprehensive validation, stress, and sensitivity testing.
- **Weeks 17-18:** Phase 7 — Production hardening, monitoring, documentation, GO/NO-GO decision.

Progression between phases requires meeting well-defined success metrics, passing quality gates, and completing deliverables. Rollback plans ensure safe recovery from phase-level failures without jeopardizing the overall schedule.

| Data quality issues | Low | High | Missing features or sentiment data | Phase 0 validation, automated data checks before training | MLE | Data validation alerts |
| Reward hacking | Medium | Medium | Agents exploit loopholes (e.g., minimal trading) | Reward auditing, policy visualization, degenerate behavior tests | MLE + RLS | Degenerate action distributions |
| Overfitting | Medium | Medium | Good in-sample but poor out-of-sample | Walk-forward validation, regularization, dropout, randomization | MLE + RM | OOS performance drop |
| Monitoring gaps | Low | High | Production incidents unnoticed | Implement comprehensive logging, alerts, rehearsed drills | DevOps + RM | Missing alert coverage |

## Success Criteria

### Phase-Level Success Gates
- **Phase 0:** Environment, data, SL baselines ready; scripts executed successfully.
- **Phase 1:** Environments validated with tests, performance, and compatibility benchmarks.
- **Phase 2:** Architectures implemented with forward-pass tests and documented budgets.
- **Phase 3:** ≥5/10 prototype agents exceed Sharpe thresholds and stability achieved.
- **Phase 4:** ≥90% of 143 agents meet validation Sharpe >0.2 with reliable infrastructure.
- **Phase 5:** Master agent lifts portfolio Sharpe >0.8 with drawdown <30%.
- **Phase 6:** System passes walk-forward, stress, comparison, sensitivity, and OOS tests.
- **Phase 7:** Serving, risk, monitoring, docs ready; GO/NO-GO decision made.

### Final Success Metrics (Week 18)
- Portfolio Sharpe > 1.0 (validation), max drawdown < 30%, win rate > 50%, profit factor > 1.3.
- Outperforms SPY by >5% annualized and best SL configuration.
- Robust under stress and sensitivity variations.
- Fully documented, monitored, and ready for paper trading.

### MVP Fallback Targets
- ≥50 symbol agents performing well.
- Portfolio Sharpe > 0.6 with positive returns and controlled risk.

## Quality Gates & Validation Checkpoints
- **Gate 0→1:** Environment/data scripts signed off; baseline report approved.
- **Gate 1→2:** Environment unit tests + benchmarks verified; architecture interfaces stable.
- **Gate 2→3:** Encoder/policy tests green; PPO training dry-run completed.
- **Gate 3→4:** Prototype analysis accepted; hyperparameters frozen.
- **Gate 4→5:** Validation dashboard shows ≥90% agents meeting criteria.
- **Gate 5→6:** Master agent backtest confirms Sharpe/drawdown targets.
- **Gate 6→7:** Validation dossier approved by RM and leadership.
- **Post Phase 7:** GO/NO-GO meeting documented.

## Rollback Strategies by Phase
- **Phase 0:** Revert to prior environment snapshots; prioritize fixing environment/data before progressing.
- **Phase 1:** Simplify observation space; rollback to minimal reward; postpone vectorization if necessary.
- **Phase 2:** Swap transformer encoder for simpler MLP/LSTM temporarily; maintain interface to avoid downstream breakage.
- **Phase 3:** Pause scaling, revisit hyperparameters, consider reward adjustments; extend timeline ≤1 week.
- **Phase 4:** Suspend failing agent groups, re-run with adjusted configs; use cloud burst to recover schedule.
- **Phase 5:** Roll back to frozen-symbol baseline; disable joint fine-tuning if destabilizing.
- **Phase 6:** Identify weak windows/regimes, retrain specific agents or re-weight portfolio; do not proceed to production until resolved.
- **Phase 7:** Delay deployment, iterate on latency or risk controls; preserve validated models until issues resolved.

## Monitoring, Reporting, and Communication Cadence
- **Weekly status reports:** Progress, blockers, metrics per phase, shared with stakeholders every Friday.
- **Phase transition reviews:** 1-hour meeting to review success criteria, quality gate artifacts, and approve progression.
- **Incident channel:** Dedicated Slack/Teams channel for training incidents, with documented escalation path.
- **Documentation updates:** Memory-bank docs refreshed at the end of each phase, ensuring knowledge continuity.

## Deliverables Checklist
- `docs/setup_rl_environment.md` (Phase 0).
- `data/validation_report.json` (updated) and `scripts/validate_rl_data_readiness.py`.

- `docs/baseline_for_rl_comparison.md` baseline report.
- `core/rl/environments/`, `core/rl/utils/`, `core/rl/rewards/`, `core/rl/agents/`, `core/rl/policies/` modules with tests.
- Benchmark and profiling reports under `analysis/reports/`.
- `train_symbol_agents.py`, MLflow experiment configurations, tensorboard logs.
- Hyperparameter configuration files (`training/rl/configs/`).
- 143 agent checkpoints + validation reports + ensemble analysis.
- Master agent checkpoints and portfolio backtests.
- Validation dossier (walk-forward, stress, comparison, sensitivity, OOS).
- ONNX exports, serving API code, risk control modules, monitoring dashboards.
- Updated memory-bank documentation, deployment runbook, troubleshooting guide.
- GO/NO-GO decision memo and (if GO) paper trading plan.

## Iteration & Adaptation Guidelines
- **Behind schedule:** Reduce agent scope (e.g., train top 50 symbols first), skip joint fine-tuning, or extend timeline with stakeholder approval while preserving quality gates.
- **Ahead of schedule:** Explore advanced architectures (GNNs), alternative RL algorithms (SAC, TD3), or accelerated paper trading entry.
- **If outcomes disappointing:** Reinvest in SL enhancements (threshold tuning, regime filters), adopt hybrid strategies (RL timing + SL selection), or engage external RL expertise.

## Reporting Templates & Tools
- **Status Template:** Summary, accomplishments, risks, mitigations, next steps.
- **Quality Gate Checklist:** Artifact list, test results, approvals.
- **Risk Log:** Maintained in `docs/risk_register_rl.xlsx`, updated weekly.
- **MLflow Experiment Tags:** Phase, symbol count, hyperparameter version, reward version.
