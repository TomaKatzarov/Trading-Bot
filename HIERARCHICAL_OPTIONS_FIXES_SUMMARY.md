# Hierarchical Options Training Collapse - Critical Fixes Applied

**Date:** 2025-10-17  
**Status:** ✅ All fixes implemented and validated  
**Files Modified:** 2 (train_sac_with_options.py, trading_options.py)

---

## Executive Summary

The hierarchical options training was completely collapsed with:
- **0 evaluation performance** after 990k steps
- **Instant option terminations** (all options terminating after 1 step)
- **Only 3/6 options used** (OpenLong and Scalp never activated)
- **Massive policy loss** (-420) indicating unstable training

**Root Causes Identified:**
1. ❌ No action_scale mechanism (options didn't modulate SAC actions)
2. ❌ No min_duration enforcement (options could terminate instantly)
3. ❌ Linear termination probabilities starting at 0.1 from step 0
4. ❌ No advantage normalization (gradient explosion)
5. ❌ No entropy bonus (option collapse to subset)
6. ❌ No temperature annealing (poor exploration)

**All issues have been systematically fixed.**

## Part 1: Core Architecture Fixes (train_sac_with_options.py)

### Fix 1: Action Scale Mechanism
**Problem:** Options were selecting strategies but SAC actions were being used directly without modulation.

**Solution:** Added per-option action_scale to control action magnitude:

```python
# OptionEnvState dataclass
action_scales: Dict[int, float] = None  # Action scale per option index

# In select_actions method
action_scale = state.action_scales.get(option_idx, 1.0)
scaled_action = sac_actions[env_idx] * action_scale
actions[env_idx] = self._format_action(scaled_action)
```

**Configuration:**
- OpenLong: 0.8 (moderate actions for building)
- OpenShort: 0.8 (moderate actions for shorting)
- ClosePosition: 1.0 (full actions for exits)
- TrendFollow: 0.6 (moderate actions for trend riding)
- Scalp: 1.0 (full actions for quick trades)
- Wait: 0.0 (no actions during observation)

---

### Fix 2: Minimum Duration Enforcement
**Problem:** Options could terminate after 1 step due to stochastic sampling of termination probability.

**Solution:** Dual enforcement at wrapper level:

```python
# OptionEnvState dataclass
min_durations: Dict[int, int] = None  # Minimum duration per option

# In select_actions method
min_duration = state.min_durations.get(option_idx, 0)
if state.option_step_count < min_duration:
    terminated = False  # Force continuation
else:
    # Check termination probability only after min_duration
    term_prob = option.termination_probability(...)
    terminated = np.random.random() < term_prob
```

**Configuration:**
- OpenLong: 5 steps
- OpenShort: 5 steps
- ClosePosition: 3 steps
- TrendFollow: 10 steps (needs time for trend)
- Scalp: 5 steps
- Wait: 5 steps

---

### Fix 3: Advantage Normalization
**Problem:** Advantages ranged from -8.1 to large values, causing gradient explosion.

**Solution:** Normalize advantages before computing policy loss:

```python
# In train_options_controller method
advantages = option_returns - predicted_values.detach()

if self.normalize_advantages and advantages.numel() > 1:
    advantages = (advantages - advantages.mean()) / (advantages.std() + self.advantage_epsilon)

policy_loss = -(selected_log_probs * advantages).mean()
```

**Configuration:**
- normalize_advantages: true
- advantage_epsilon: 1e-8

---

### Fix 4: Entropy Bonus
**Problem:** Policy collapsed to only 3 options (no diversity).

**Solution:** Add entropy bonus to encourage exploration:

```python
# In train_options_controller method
probs = torch.softmax(scaled_logits, dim=-1)
entropy = -(probs * log_probs).sum(dim=-1).mean()
entropy_bonus_loss = -self.entropy_bonus * entropy

total_loss = policy_loss + value_loss_weight * value_loss + entropy_bonus_loss
```

**Configuration:**
- entropy_bonus: 0.01 (balance between diversity and performance)

---

### Fix 5: Temperature Annealing
**Problem:** No exploration schedule, leading to premature convergence.

**Solution:** Temperature scaling with decay:

```python
# In __init__
self.current_temperature = self.temperature  # Start at 1.0

# In train_options_controller
scaled_logits = option_logits / max(self.current_temperature, self.min_temperature)

# After optimizer step
self.current_temperature = max(
    self.min_temperature,
    self.current_temperature * self.temperature_decay
)
```

**Configuration:**
- temperature: 1.0 (start)
- temperature_decay: 0.9995
- min_temperature: 0.1 (end)

**Behavior:** 500k steps → temperature decays to ~0.22 (good exploration→exploitation balance)

---

### Fix 6: Enhanced Monitoring & Collapse Detection
**Problem:** No early warning system for option collapse.

**Solution:** Enhanced OptionsMonitorCallback:

```python
# Detect option collapse
max_usage = max(usage_pct.values())
num_used_options = sum(1 for pct in usage_pct.values() if pct > 0.05)

if max_usage > self.collapse_threshold:
    LOGGER.warning(
        "⚠️  OPTION COLLAPSE DETECTED! Single option has %.1f%% usage "
        "(threshold: %.1f%%). Only %d/%d options being used.",
        max_usage * 100, threshold * 100, num_used, total
    )

# Alert on instant terminations
if duration > 0 and duration < min_duration * 0.5:
    LOGGER.warning(
        "⚠️  Option %d has avg duration %.1f (min_duration: %d). "
        "Options terminating too early!",
        option_idx, duration, min_duration
    )
```

**Metrics Added:**
- options/num_used_options
- options/max_usage_pct
- options/temperature
- options/entropy
- options/grad_norm

---

## Part 2: Termination Logic Fixes (trading_options.py)

### New Helper Function: sigmoid_termination_prob()
**Problem:** Old linear probabilities started at 0.1 from step 0.

**Solution:** Smooth sigmoid curves that enforce min_duration:

```python
def sigmoid_termination_prob(step: int, min_duration: int, max_steps: int, steepness: float = 0.5) -> float:
    if step < min_duration:
        return 0.0  # Forced continuation
    
    if step >= max_steps:
        return 1.0  # Forced termination
    
    progress = (step - min_duration) / max(1, max_steps - min_duration)
    x = progress - 0.5
    sigmoid = 1.0 / (1.0 + np.exp(-steepness * 10 * x))
    
    return sigmoid * 0.8  # Cap at 80% to allow stochastic sampling
```

**Behavior:**
- Step < min_duration: 0% (forced continuation)
- Step = 50% progress: ~40% probability
- Step = max_steps: 100% (forced termination)

---

### Option-Specific Termination Improvements

#### OpenLongOption (Building Long Positions)
**Old:** Linear 0.1 + (step/max) * 0.3 → instant terminations  
**New:** 
- Success-based: 100% if position_size >= 90% of target
- min_duration=5 enforced
- Sigmoid curve for time-based fallback

#### OpenShortOption (Building Short Positions)
**Old:** Linear 0.1 + (step/max) * 0.3 → instant terminations  
**New:**
- Success-based: 100% if position_size >= 90% of target
- Sentiment-based: 80% if sentiment > 0.60 (turned bullish)
- min_duration=5 enforced
- Sigmoid curve for time-based fallback

#### ClosePositionOption (Exit Management)
**Old:** Fixed 0.05 probability → premature termination  
**New:**
- Success-based: 100% if position_size < 0.01 (closed)
- min_duration=3 enforced (needs time to execute)
- Very low probability (0.02) if position still open

#### TrendFollowOption (Trend Riding)
**Old:** 0.10 baseline + 0.80 if trend weak → instant terminations  
**New:**
- Success-based: 85% if trend < 50% of threshold (exhausted)
- min_duration=10 enforced (trends need time)
- Sigmoid curve capped at 15% for time-based
- Trend strength should control termination, not time

#### ScalpOption (Quick Profits)
**Old:** Linear 0.1 + (step/max) * 0.4 → instant terminations  
**New:**
- Success-based: 100% if position_size < 0.01 (trade closed)
- min_duration=5 enforced
- Sigmoid curve for time-based (steepness=0.6, faster curve)

#### WaitOption (Observation)
**Old:** Linear 0.15 + progress * 0.35 → early terminations  
**New:**
- Success-based: 85% on sentiment extremes (< 0.30 or > 0.75)
- Success-based: 75% on strong trend (> 3% divergence)
- Success-based: 65% on strong SL confidence (> 0.75)
